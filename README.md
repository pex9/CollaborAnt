## What's New in This Release (lab5)
### Firebase Google Authentication
We have implemented user authentication following Firebase guidelines. Each time a user authenticates, a unique UUID is created. This UUID is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient authentication system.

### Firebase DB Interaction
## 1. User Information Management

We created a `users` collection to store comprehensive information about each user. Each document within this collection includes properties such as:
- Name
- Profile photo URL or color of the monogram
- Address
- UUID (provided by Google)
- JoinedTeams
- Nickname
- Telephone
- Location
- Email

This structure ensures a one-to-one relationship between user authentication and user information.
Due to the 1 MB size limit for documents in Firestore, we utilize Firebase Storage for saving user profile images. Each user's image is stored with a filename that matches the user's unique UUID, ensuring easy retrieval and management.
Each user has a subcollection named `kpivalues` within their document to store the current KPI data for each team they are working with. This allows us to efficiently track and manage individual performance metrics.

## 2. Team Management

We created a `teams` collection where each document represents a team and contains:
- Description
- Image or color of the monogram
- list of memebers
- list of roles
- Name of the team
- Unread message flag

Each team document also has a subcollection named `chat`, which stores the current messages exchanged within the team. 
We use the Firestore-generated ID for the team to generate links or QR codes for team invitations.
Every time a user uses a link to join a team, their information is added to the list of members, and their initial role is set to "Junior Member" by default.

## 3. Task Management

A separate `tasks` collection was established to manage tasks. Each task document includes details such as:
- Title
- Categories
- Due date
- End Date
- Repeat
- Tag
- Team id
- Parent id (if is a recurrent task)
-  Delegated Members to the task
- Other relevant task information

Within each task document, there are several subcollections:
- `history`: Contains a list of actions related to the task.
- `comments`: Stores all related messages for the task.

To work with attachments, we use Firebase Storage to handle files related to the task properly.

### New UI Palette
We've introduced a fresh new color palette to improve the visual appeal and usability of the app. Hereâ€™s a preview of the new palette:
